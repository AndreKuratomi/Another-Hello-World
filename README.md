# The young boy's trick with rice and a chess border.

""""As I'm new here in GitHub I decided to try to code that indian story of the young man, the king, the chess border and the rice seeds.

The young man asked the king to put one seed of rice in the first square and multiply it by 2 in the second one, and on the third the amount of the second multiplied by 2 again and so on till the 64th square. The result of the young man's request, 2 raised by 64, will be almost 20 quintillions of seeds! 

How to turn this on code? How to create a little code which you write the number of the square and the code will return the amount of seeds in that square?

Here's my attempt to solve this using Python. Good luck for me!"""
